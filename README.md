## Problems, Resolution and Learning

We faced a number of conflicts while pushing over github, for the resolution, we had to analyse the root problems that were causing those conflicts. With little insights, we got the issues there and hence fixed them.
Another problem came in the form of big bugs. We came across many bugs at the end moment and had to pause our work just for the sake of those silly mistakes that we had made. Other then these, we had problems in javascript and css libraries for which we had to read their documentations. Our icons and navbar ran into problems while doing some media queries, but at last we fixed them too.

Every member of the team learnt so many new things including resolving conflicts, making push and pull over github, use of typical media queries for responsiveness,  most important of them, we learnt team work skills and got to know how to handle issues collectively.

## Justification of Theme

In today's era when people crave for western health treatments and equpiments, our ancient and efficacious treatment methods and excercise forms have started to loose their significance.
In order to remind people of their rich cultural aspects we bringforth this website MUKTI to rejuvinate the feeling of pride and respect for our traditional methods. In current situation of pandemic, we see people making a traditional drink called 'KADHA' in order to strengthen their immune system.
The system of medicines is solely based on herbs and herbal compounds cures the patient completely by going to the depth of the illness. They are affordable yet highly effective methods.
    So here we are with MUKTI to spread awareness and help our traditional practices gain the popularity and respect they deserve. Our website has cards with incluse YOGA, AYURVEDA, SIDDHA etc and important information related to them. The UI and functionality is very easy smooth and we hope to reach many people and fulfill the purpose.
